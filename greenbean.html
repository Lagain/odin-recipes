        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This recipe is for green bean casserole which I personally think is pretty nasty. I don't even really know if I've eaten it before, but the vibe is off.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Green beans</li>
            <li>Noodles?</li>
            <li>Like what else is in it?</li>
            <li>I don't know if you should put love in this one</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>First string the green beans. That's important unless you're quirky and LOVE eating green bean strings. Maybe that's a thing I actually don't know</li>
            <li>You should mix the green beans and the noodles maybe? Put em together? Wait maybe cook them both first?</li>
            <li>I don't know howt his recipe is made.</li>
        </ol>
